item.type: command_execution
parse markdown: no
color: gray
introduce command: /togglefullcommandoutput (default terse, max five lines of command + command output) the slash command /togglefullcommandoutput would toggle between full command output and the breviated command output.

item.type: reasoning
some dark blue/pink in the outrun electric palette (that is not the same as either reasoning or agent_message text)
parse markdown (reasoning text is markdown formatted, make sure ** bold is different color than normal text). Make sure reasoning is italic by default, that means markdown bold ** should be bold italic in the output somehow.

item.type: agent_message
normal white console color, but parse markdown, make ** bold, *italic* italic, make `text` another color indicating it's something other than normal text, etc.
